## [Exercise 7.1](ex7_1/main.cpp)

> Write a version of the transaction-processing program from § 1.6 (p. 24) using the *Sales_data* class you defined for the exercises § 2.6.1 (p. 72).


## [Exercise 7.2](ex7_2/main.cpp)

>Add the *combine* and *isbn* members to the *Sales_data* class you wrote for the exercises in § 2.6.2 (p. 76).

## [Exercise 7.3](ex7_3/main.cpp)

> Revise your transaction-processing program from § 7.1.1 (p. 256) to use these members.


## [Exercise 7.4](ex7_4/main.cpp)

> Write a class named *Person* that represents the name and address ofa person. Use a *string* to hold each of these elements. Subsequent exercises will incrementally add features to this class.


## [Exercise 7.5](ex7_5/main.cpp)

> Provide operations in your *Person* class to return to the name and address. Should these functions be *const*? Explain your choice.


- They should be const
	- the reason is that they are not changing any class element just reading, this should be signified to the users via const function declaration.




## [Exercise 7.6](ex7_6/main.cpp)

> Define your own version of the *add*, *read*, and *print* functions.
